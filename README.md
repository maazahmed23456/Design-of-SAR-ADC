# Bandgap Reference Design 
This project simulates the designed Bandgap Reference circuit to determine its performance characterisitics pre-layout and post-layout. 

*Note: Circuit requires further optimization to improve performance. Design yet to be modified.*


## A Glance at the Bandgap Reference IP

A reference voltage, generated by the band-gap reference (BGR) circuit, that has little to no dependence on the process, temperature, power supply variation is imperative for correct operation and performance of several analog and mixed-signal systems. BGR blocks are used in data converters-ADCs & DACs, LDOs, DRAMs, encoders & decoders, signal processing blocks, sensor interfaces, and several other applications. Therefore, a designer should take care to design a BGR circuit with a high power supply rejection ratio and an extremely low temperature coefficient. Since, the output reference voltage is approximately equal to the intrinsic band-gap voltage
(1.2eV) of the semiconductor material used, silicon, it acquires the name of band-gap reference.[4] The principle of generation, Implementation, Issues & Improvements, Conclusion, and Future Scope will be discussed further

## Tools used and steps to reproduce all waveforms (Tools allowed are xschem/eSim/ngspice) 
Ngspice is an open source mixed-signal circuit simulator.

### Installing Ngspice

#### For Ubuntu

Open your terminal and type the following to install Ngspice
```
$  sudo apt-get install -y ngspice
```

## Running the Simulation


To enter the Ngspice Shell, open the terminal & type:
```
$ ngspice
```
To simulate a netlist, type:
```
ngspice 1 ->  source <filename>.cir
```

You can exit from the Ngspice Shell by typing:
```
ngspice 1 ->  exit
```
 <p align="center"> or </p>
 
```
ngspice 1 ->  quit
```

There are several waveforms that need to be obtained to observe the performance of the Bandgap reference circuit.

### Pre-Layout Simulation

To clone the Repository and download the Netlist files for Simulation, enter the following commands in your terminal.

```
$  sudo apt install -y git
$  git clone https://github.com/sherylcorina/avsdbgp_3v3
$  cd avsdbgp_3v3/Simulation/Ngspice_Simulation/Final_Simulation/PreLayout
```

***************



## Future Work

1. Improved matching techniques such as Common Centroid / Interdigitisation need to be implemented while laying out the current mirror.
2. PNR for the designed circuit is yet to performed using the Open Source Tool provided by the OpenROAD project.
3. Corner Analysis Testing of the bandgap reference circuit is yet to be performed.
4. The load driving capability needs to be improved by addition of a buffer block such as an OTA or a common drain amplifier.
5. To adjust the reference voltage resistors must be trimmed using fuses, hence, resistor trimming must be employed in the circuit.
6. The design must be improved to provide a higher PSRR.
7. In the future an OTA based bandgap reference circuit will be developed with improved performance characteristics. Also, a second order bandgap reference will be studied and developed, to improve the temperature coefficient.
8. To solve the problem of unwanted parasitic BJTs being extracted due to the modification made in the Technology File.
